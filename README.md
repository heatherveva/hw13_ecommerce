# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Description

This ecommerce backend links MySQL database with api routes to collect user information, as well as store product and tag related information.

The models in this project define the MySQL tables and their relationships to one another, while the routes determine what information is displayed, stored, updated, and deleted.

## Installation

This application requires Express.js, Sequelize, and MySQL database.

## Walkthrough

A note about the product routes: the put and post send requests return a 400 error. However, they are both working and I do show proof that the create and updates do hit the database, despite the 400 error.
